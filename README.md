# 'BECOME A QA AUTOMATION' - Week 10 - Events & HTTP.

This project consists of working on the Login and a Register Forms done on Week 9, adding validations that will be executed when some events occur. Every field on the 
form will have a series of conditions that will be validated when events are triggered. Once the fields on the form are validated, the data will be sent through an HTTP request to a fictional webpage.

## Description
The instruction of this project specifies the validations that should be added to each form:

**Login form:**
- Email: must have a valid email format.
- Password: At least 8 characters, containing letters and numbers.

**Register form:**
- Full name: It must have more than 6 letters and at least one space in between.
- Email: must have a valid email format.
